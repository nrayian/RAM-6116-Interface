# RAM-6116-Interface
Saving data using RAM
I have designed a 6116 RAM that is 2k X 8 static RAM. The 6116 consists of eleven address pins, eight data pins, a chip enable, output enable and a write enable. My setup requires a 6116, logicprobes, logicstates and switches, and I have completed the design using Proteus 8. I took eleven logicprobes and connected them to the address pins, eight logicstates and linked them with data pins of the 6116 RAM. In order to modify the data, I have used eight more logicprobes and joined them to the data wires through respective switches, so that changing any values will not directly affect the data. I have connected three more logicprobes to a chip enable, output enable and write enable which will allow me to read and write values. For storing the data, the write enable needs to set to 0(zero) with desired address and chip enable have to be changed from 0(zero) to 1(one). In order to read the stored data, the output enable has to be set to 0(zero), keeping write enable 1(one) and changing the value of chip enable from 0(zero) to 1(one) with the desired address.
